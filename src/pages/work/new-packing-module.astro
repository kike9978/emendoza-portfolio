    >
        While the farm already had a platform for managing other aspects of
        their operation, the packing and shipping processes relied heavily on a
        patchwork of spreadsheets and informal messaging. This led to
        inefficiencies, communication breakdowns, and a lack of real-time
        visibility into progress and potential issues.

            Embracing User-Centered Design
        </h2>
        <p class="text-cyan-950 text-lg font-normal leading-[29.34px] md:mt-7">
            To ensure the new module met the specific needs of the farm's
            workflow, we prioritized user-centered design principles. This
            involved conducting workshops and user interviews with key
            stakeholders, particularly the shipment leader and packing leader,
            who would be the primary users of the module. Through these
            sessions, we aimed to gain a deep understanding of their daily
            tasks, pain points, and desired functionalities.

        Deep User Understanding

        Through workshops and user interviews, we delved into the user
        workflows, analyzing the vast spreadsheets used to manage tasks. This
        revealed a complex, real-world process far removed from the initial
        platform's simplified model. By understanding user pain points and their
        daily routines, we could redefine the critical tasks performed by the
        shipment and packing leaders
